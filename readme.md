# OnlyFriday - a simple Minecraft Plugin

A little Minecraft Plugin, to allow players to only join on Friday.
Of course each player can, depending on the permissions, change that with the `/toggleFriday` command.
Operators aka Admins can change other players' settings with the `/toggleOtherFriday [player]` command.

This is too specific for most servers lol
